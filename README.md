Here is a description of each Python program, its respective file name, and its intended purpose.

1.	Problem1Infinite.py - This program will print the word "Infinite" in a loop that never ends. It uses a while statement that is always True.

2.	Problem2SumofTen.py - This program will use a while loop to append the current value of the current counter variable to the list and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop then stops once the counter value is greater than 10.

3.	Problem3NumList.py - This program will use a while loop to prompt the user for a number. It then appends each entered number to a list and adds them together until the sum of the list of numbers is greater than 100. When the sum totals 100 or more, the program breaks and prints the total sum.

4.	Problem4NumListDivide.py - This program will use a while loop to initialize a counter at 0. As it processes, it will max out to a value of 50. If it finds a value that is divisible by 10, it will append that value to the list and then generate a list showing the numbers from that list called "tens".
